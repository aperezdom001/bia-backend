# SURVIVOR back end

In this repo, I constructed my back end with Express and mongoDB. The purpose of this backend is to 
store the player's initials and score when the game is over in the front end. I used a program called
Postman to test out my CRUD functionality and when that was successful I connected it to my front end 
making SURVIVOR a full-stack web game.
